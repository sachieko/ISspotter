# ISS Spotter 

## This program uses a mock API for tracking ISS flyovers, so times are not actually usable unfortunately.

This program references 3 different API's in order to get the next 5 flyovers of the ISS for your geographic location via your IP.


## Note there are two versions. index.js and index2.js are two separate versions. They have the same functionality

### index2.js uses promises, and index.js uses nested callbacks or callback hell.
